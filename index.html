    <p>Hello! My name is Jonathan Garcia, I am a Junior Web Developer based out of Chicago. I have been working in the service industry since 2017 and currently work as a manager at Bartaco Restaurant. In 2018, I graduated from Tufts University with a B.S. in Biopsychology and a minor in Film Production. Much of my professional experience is in customer service but my hobbies include film production and content creation. In the summer of 2020 I decided to not continue into grad school and instead teach myself coding to go into tech. I used to think that coding was only for the smartest of the smart and that it was out of reach for myself. But after delving into Harvard comp sci 101 class, I realized that not only could I understand and achieve this skill, I enjoyed and had fun doing so! After taking that introductory course, I decided to put more skin in the game and attend a bootcamp through Flatiron School for Web Developing. This is where I learned front and back end coding with Javascript, ReactJS, and Ruby on Rails.</p>
